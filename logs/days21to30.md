# Log of days 21 to 30

## Day 21: 21st March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I have been learning a bit more about list comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions. I have learnt a little bit about these in the past, but have never really used them in practice. 

I updated my [states game](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days21to30/day21/states_updated/main.py) to optimise the code using a list comprehension. This replaced a four line for loop, shortening this down to just one line of code.

I also made a [nato phonetic alphabet word converter](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days21to30/day21/nato_alphabet/main.py) which loads in a csv containing the nato phonetic alphabet and converts this into a dictionary. The user is then asked for a word and then the program loops through the word and pulls out the corresponding value.

### Thoughts:

I enjoyed today, made me realise there are definitely times in the past where I should've maybe been using a list/dictionary comprehension instead of a for loop. I like how they make the code more concise and readable.

Excited to learn about tkinter tomorrow :)

## Day 22: 22nd March 2021

### Today's progress

Today I have been learning about Tkinter, and have been playing around with some basic gui programs.

I made my own [miles to km converter](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days21to30/day22/day22_miles_to_km.py) it's quite basic but I'm happy that I can do stuff like this now! Excited to build more programs which utilise gui's in the future.

### Thoughts:

Found today fairly straight forward, although this was definitely a bit of a step up from the turtle programs I have been making. Excited for more of this tomorrow :)

## Day 23: 23rd March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a [pomodoro timer](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days21to30/day23/day23_pomodoro.py) using my new Tkinter skills

### Thoughts:

Feeling a bit more confident with Tkinter now, enjoyed this project and can actually see myself using this regularly.

## Day 24: 24th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a [password manager](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days21to30/day24/day24_password_manager.py) GUI program which exports inputted passwords to a [data.txt file](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days21to30/day24/data.txt) for storage. Spoilers the example file contains fake email and passwords!

The program can also generate a password for you if you're feeling particularly uncreative.

### Thoughts:

Nice little program, I enjoyed making this. Impressed with Tkinters broad range of functions but a little dissapointed in the terrible documentation!
