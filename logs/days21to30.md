# Log of days 21 to 30

## Day 21: 21st March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I have been learning a bit more about list comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions. I have learnt a little bit about these in the past, but have never really used them in practice. 

I updated my [states game](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days21to30/day21/states_updated/main.py) to optimise the code using a list comprehension. This replaced a four line for loop, shortening this down to just one line of code.

I also made a [nato phonetic alphabet word converter](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days21to30/day21/nato_alphabet/main.py) which loads in a csv containing the nato phonetic alphabet and converts this into a dictionary. The user is then asked for a word and then the program loops through the word and pulls out the corresponding value.

### Thoughts:

I enjoyed today, made me realise there are definitely times in the past where I should've maybe been using a list/dictionary comprehension instead of a for loop. I like how they make the code more concise and readable.

Excited to learn about tkinter tomorrow :)
