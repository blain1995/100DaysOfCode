# Log of days 11 to 20

## Day 11: 11th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a [coffee machine script](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day11/day11_coffee.py) which takes a drink order, checks to see if the resources are available to make the drink, takes in coins and determines if total is enough to pay for the drink, and finally vends the drink.

### Thoughts:

I think this is my favourite project so far!
(despite the fact I really was not in the mood to code today)

## Day 12: 12th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Started some projects using object orientated programming, very different from the previous procedural programming projects I have completed.

Tried to remake my coffee machine project but haven't quite polished it yet.. will upload the script tomorrow!

### Thoughts:

Fun! Definitely a step up from what I had been doing, but very enjoyable!

## Day 13: 13th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Finished my [coffee machine script](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day12/day12_OOPcoffee.py) which is the same as my previous coffee machine but uses object orientated programming concepts

Also played around with turtle and pretty table

### Thoughts:

Today was really fun! After having learned about object orientated programming in datacamp a while ago I'm excited to be finally attempting projects which include these skills!

Today was challenging but rewarding :)
