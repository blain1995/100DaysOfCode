# Log of days 11 to 20

## Day 11: 11th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a [coffee machine script](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day11/day11_coffee.py) which takes a drink order, checks to see if the resources are available to make the drink, takes in coins and determines if total is enough to pay for the drink, and finally vends the drink.

### Thoughts:

I think this is my favourite project so far!
(despite the fact I really was not in the mood to code today)

## Day 12: 12th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Started some projects using object orientated programming, very different from the previous procedural programming projects I have completed.

Tried to remake my coffee machine project but haven't quite polished it yet.. will upload the script tomorrow!

### Thoughts:

Fun! Definitely a step up from what I had been doing, but very enjoyable!

## Day 13: 13th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Finished my [coffee machine script](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day12/day12_OOPcoffee.py) which is the same as my previous coffee machine but uses object orientated programming concepts

Also played around with turtle and pretty table

### Thoughts:

Today was really fun! After having learned about object orientated programming in datacamp a while ago I'm excited to be finally attempting projects which include these skills!

Today was challenging but rewarding :)

## Day 14: 14th March 2021

### Today's progress:

[Practiced](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day14/day14_oop_test.py) making classes and defining attributes and methods before making a quiz.

The quiz uses [data](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day14/data.py) , a [question model](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day14/question_model.py) and a [quiz brain](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day14/quiz_brain.py) which contain classes and are utilised in the [main script](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day14/main.py)

### Thoughts:

Really enjoyed today again, definitely getting the hang of oop and feeling a lot more confident with it. 

## Day 15: 15th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I spent a little time getting used to using [turtle](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day15/day15_turtle.py) drawing basic shapes and getting used to assigning aesthetics

I then used turtle to make a little [painting](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day15/day15_painting.py), similar to ones made by Damien Hirst. This extracts RGB values from a downloaded [jpeg](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day15/hirst.jpg)

### Thoughts:

This was really fun, I'm excited to use turtle more in the future.

## Day 16: 16th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I learnt more about turtle and played around with the turtle,listen() method, as shown [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day16/day16_turtle.py)

Then I used these new skills to make my own [etch-a-sketch](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day16/day16_etch_a_sketch.py) program.

Finally I created a [turtle race](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day16/day16_turtlerace.py) program where you can place a bet on which turtle you believe will win.

### Thoughts:

Again, really enjoyed this evenings project. I'm enjoying creating these little games.

## Day 17: 17th March 2021

## Today's progress:

Today I started making my own version of the classic game [snake!](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day17/day17_main.py)

This uses OOP and imports a snake class from a seperate [script](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days11to20/day17/day17_snake.py)

I just worked on the animation today, I will fully finish this tomorrow :)

## Thoughts:

Definitely more comfortable with turtle for animation, especially when setting the headings of objects etc... excited to finish my game tomorrow!
