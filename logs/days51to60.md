# Log of days 51 to 60

## Day 51: 10th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I carried out a capstone project based on automated data entry. I built a [program](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days51to60/day51/data_entry.py) to scrape house listings from zoopla, make lists including the prices, addresses and links to property and then finally used selenium to input all of this data into a google form.

### Thoughts:

Found this project relatively straightforward :) completed it with only a couple of minor issues.
