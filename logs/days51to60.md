# Log of days 51 to 60

## Day 51: 21st April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I carried out a capstone project based on automated data entry. I built a [program](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days51to60/day51/data_entry.py) to scrape house listings from zoopla, make lists including the prices, addresses and links to property and then finally used selenium to input all of this data into a google form.

### Thoughts:

Found this project relatively straightforward :) completed it with only a couple of minor issues.

## Day 52: 22nd April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I played around with Flask and some decorator functions, and then started a project whichh I will finish and upload tomorrow.

### Thoughts:

Challenging, definitely think my python skills are quite broad now! Prior to starting 100 days of code my python skills were very data science specific.

## Day 53: 23rd April 2021

## Today's progress: 

Have quite a big presentation next week so dedicated todays coding time to thesis based work, which I have uploaded to my thesis repository (currently private but will be made public soon)

## Thoughts:

Trying not to let work take over, although I think I may have tomorrow off as I really need a rest and feel like I am pushing myself to do a lot at once - trying to avoid burn out!
