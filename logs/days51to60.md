# Log of days 51 to 60

## Day 51: 21st April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I carried out a capstone project based on automated data entry. I built a [program](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days51to60/day51/data_entry.py) to scrape house listings from zoopla, make lists including the prices, addresses and links to property and then finally used selenium to input all of this data into a google form.

### Thoughts:

Found this project relatively straightforward :) completed it with only a couple of minor issues.

## Day 52: 22nd April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I played around with Flask and some decorator functions, and then started a project whichh I will finish and upload tomorrow.

### Thoughts:

Challenging, definitely think my python skills are quite broad now! Prior to starting 100 days of code my python skills were very data science specific.

## Day 53: 23rd April 2021

### Today's progress: 

Have quite a big presentation next week so dedicated todays coding time to thesis based work, which I have uploaded to my thesis repository (currently private but will be made public soon)

### Thoughts:

Trying not to let work take over, although I think I may have tomorrow off as I really need a rest and feel like I am pushing myself to do a lot at once - trying to avoid burn out!

## Day 54: 25th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I used flask to make a web based [number guessing game](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days51to60/day54/number_guess.py) where you click the link in the python console and it takes you to a webpage asking you to guess a number and add it to the end of the url, the homepage then updates to tell you if your guess was too high/low or correct!

### Thoughts:

This was fun! Bit different to what I am used to. Getting used to decorator functions!

## Day 55: 26th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I used flask and some website templates to start building more complex websites! An example is [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days51to60/day55/name_card) 

### Thoughts:

I'm actually really excited about this - I have bought my own domain name and I think I'm going to play around with templates this weekend to get it looking nice :)

## Day 56: 27th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I learned about Jinja to allow for dyanmic HTML in website. Built a blog site which accesses blog posts from an API and uses Jinja to incorporate this into th website HTML. All files for this project are located [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days51to60/day56)

### Thoughts:

Yet another enjoyable day :) I'm excited about getting my personal site up and running :)

## Day 57: 28th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Started a project today using bootstrap, don't want to upload prematurely so will continue to work on it tomorrow and update then!

### Thoughts:

Enjoying doing a bit more of the web development stuff!

## Day 58: 29th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Still playing around with bootstrap, few more things to change before upload but don't have time to do more than 1 hour of code tonight!

### Thoughts:

Enjoyable but definitely different to my day to day coding for PhD!

## Day 59: 30th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Messed around with navbar and the grid layout in bootstrap - making progress with my bootstrap project - promise will be uploading soon!

### Thoughts:

Struggled to get the javascript to work with the latest version of bootstrap, although it is currently a beta version so maybe it's not just me! Have resorted to using an older version of bootstrap and the nav bar seems to be working now!
