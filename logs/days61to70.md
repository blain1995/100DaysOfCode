# Log of days 61 to 70

## Day 61: 2nd May 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I formatted the features and testimonial section of my fake start-up website :) I used bootstrap carousel to show multiple testimonials in a slideshow format.

### Thoughts:

It's definitely looking a lot better! Actually think it looks half decent 

## Day 62: 3rd May 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I learned about bootstrap cards and z-indexing and used it to update the pricing section of my fake start-up website

### Thoughts:

It's really starting to come together!

## Day 63: 4th May 2021 (May the fourth be with you)

### Today's progress:

Today I learned about media query breakpoints and edited my fake start-up website accordingly :) Now on mobile the main image is no longer rotated and has a static position to prevent the z-indexing seen on desktop.

Formatted a couple of other things - my aim is to finish this tomorrow and upload the full website code to here!

### Thoughts:

This actually looks like a proper website now, tomorrow I am going to refactor my code a little and finish this project

## Day 64: 5th May 2021

### Today's progress:

Tidied up my fake start up website code :) It is a fake site to find your dog it's perfect friend called [Tindog](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days61to70/day64)

### Thoughts:

This project has definitely stretched my coding abilities, I feel a lot more confident with web design now which will help with setting up my domain name properly :)

## Day 65: 6th May 2021

### Today's progress:

Revisted my blog project to add more styling using bootstrap. Still messing around with the aesthetics though! Will finish and upload tomorrow :)

### Thoughts:

Very enjoyable. I am liking CSS now that I have more developed CSS skills!

## Day 66: 7th May 2021

### Today's progress:

Finished my blog styling project that I started yesterday uses a combination of bootstrap, flask and jinja to style and host. The files can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days61to70/day65)

### Thoughts:

Definitely looks better than my first blog project! :)

## Day 67: 8th May 2021

### Today's progress:

Learnt about implementing html forms in Flask, just have one more bit to sort out before uploading code tomorrow!

### Thoughts:

Not my favourite part of html if I am honest!

## Day 68: 9th May 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I updated my [blog project](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days61to70/day65) by updating the [contact.html](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days61to70/day67/contact.html) and [main.py](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days61to70/day67/main.py) so that the contact form works and now sends an email to my gmail account with the senders contact info and message.

### Thoughts:

Glad this is working now, it was bugging me that the contact form looked nice but did nothing up until this point!
