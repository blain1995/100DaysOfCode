# Log of days 41 to 50

## Day 41: 10th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Yet more html and CSS! Have been working on my CSS skills so have started to design a slightly more advanced website than before. Fully aware this still looks awful but am going to continue to style it tomorrow. All files used can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day41)

### Thoughts:

Still finding CSS difficult!

## Day 42: 11th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Final day of CSS today, learnt about floating and clearing objects. Updated my little practice website so it looks a lot cleaner. Updated files can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day42)

### Thoughts:

Challenging but fun, happy to move back to python tomorrow though! Going to be attempting some web scraping using Beautiful Soup :) 

## Day 43: 12th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Back to python today! carried out some webscraping using Beautiful Soup :)

In the [main file](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day43/main.py) first scrapes data from a local [html file](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day43/website.html) and then moves onto a live website and finally PubMed.

I then also wrote [another file](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day43/movies.py) which scrapes Empires top 100 movies list. 

### Thoughts:

I really enjoyed today! Definitely enjoying being back to python although I'm glad I spent a few days getting used to HTML and CSS before attempting web scraping.I can see this being really helpful in the future.

## Day 44: 13th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a program which makes a [music time machine playlist](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day44/playlist.py) from a date of the users choosing.

### Thoughts:

Challenging but fun! Found the Spotipy documentation a tiny bit confusing but got there in the end! 

## Day 45: 14th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a short script which uses a combination of webscraping and the smtplib module to send an email when the prcie of an amazon product of choice falls below a target price. 

I called this program [amazon_notiPy](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day45/amazon_notiPy.py)

### Thoughts:

I found today enjoyable, definitely getting better at web scraping and more comfortable with python in general! :)
