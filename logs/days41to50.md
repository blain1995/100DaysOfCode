# Log of days 41 to 50

## Day 41: 10th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Yet more html and CSS! Have been working on my CSS skills so have started to design a slightly more advanced website than before. Fully aware this still looks awful but am going to continue to style it tomorrow. All files used can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day41)

### Thoughts:

Still finding CSS difficult!

## Day 42: 11th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Final day of CSS today, learnt about floating and clearing objects. Updated my little practice website so it looks a lot cleaner. Updated files can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day42)

### Thoughts:

Challenging but fun, happy to move back to python tomorrow though! Going to be attempting some web scraping using Beautiful Soup :) 

## Day 43: 12th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Back to python today! carried out some webscraping using Beautiful Soup :)

In the [main file](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day43/main.py) first scrapes data from a local [html file](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day43/website.html) and then moves onto a live website and finally PubMed.

I then also wrote [another file](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day43/movies.py) which scrapes Empires top 100 movies list. 

### Thoughts:

I really enjoyed today! Definitely enjoying being back to python although I'm glad I spent a few days getting used to HTML and CSS before attempting web scraping.I can see this being really helpful in the future.

## Day 44: 13th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a program which makes a [music time machine playlist](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day44/playlist.py) from a date of the users choosing.

### Thoughts:

Challenging but fun! Found the Spotipy documentation a tiny bit confusing but got there in the end! 

## Day 45: 14th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a short script which uses a combination of webscraping and the smtplib module to send an email when the prcie of an amazon product of choice falls below a target price. 

I called this program [amazon_notiPy](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day45/amazon_notiPy.py)

### Thoughts:

I found today enjoyable, definitely getting better at web scraping and more comfortable with python in general! :) 

## Day 46: 16th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Took a day off from 100 days of code yesterday as PhD got the best of me and felt very stressed!

Back on it today learning how to use selenium for web scraping. I recreated my amazon_notiPy [using selenium](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day46/main.py)

I also scraped the python website to automatically print a dictionary of there upcoming [events](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day46/python_events.py)

Also learned how to use selenium to click links and fill in search boxes using this [code](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day46/wiki.py)

Finally I used selenium to automatically play a [cookie clicker game](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day46/game.py)

### Thoughts:

Really enjoyed today! Selenium is definitely a very useful tool :)

## Day 47: 17th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Started using selenium to save LinkedIn job adverts matching a specific keyword automatically. Ran into a few issues so going to finish tomorrow!

### Thoughts:

Challenging but fun!
 
## Day 48: 18th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today  I did some python code for my PhD project, I have uploaded this to my private thesis repository!

### Thoughts:

One of the unfortunate times where work is taking over - but at least I did my hours coding!

## Day 49: 19th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I used selenium to make a [twitter bot](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day49/twitter.py) that checks my internet speed and then sends a tweet if it is slower than the provider promised.

### Thoughts:

Today was fun! enjoyed that much more than the LinkedIn project :)
