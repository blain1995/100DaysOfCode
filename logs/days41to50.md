# Log of days 41 to 50

## Day 41: 10th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Yet more html and CSS! Have been working on my CSS skills so have started to design a slightly more advanced website than before. Fully aware this still looks awful but am going to continue to style it tomorrow. All files used can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day41)

### Thoughts:

Still finding CSS difficult!

## Day 42: 11th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Final day of CSS today, learnt about floating and clearing objects. Updated my little practice website so it looks a lot cleaner. Updated files can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days41to50/day42)

### Thoughts:

Challenging but fun, happy to move back to python tomorrow though! Going to be attempting some web scraping using Beautiful Soup :)
