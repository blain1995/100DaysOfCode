# Log of days 1 to 10

## Day 1: 1st March 2021

### Today's progress:

Aware that I have learnt python in a very "on the job" approach, I'm used to using python for data wrangling/visualisation but may have some knowledge gaps.
Because of this I've decided to attempt to keep these projects seperate from the data science projects I am used to working on, and push myself to expand my python knowledge and skillset.

Decided to go back to basics and follow a udemy course which has tonnes of projects. I got through 3 days worth of projects on a udemy course I am following, as this was fairly easy for me. The quiz they have suggested I could skip ahead, but I think I am going to power through the basics over the next few days so I can experience all the projects. Because of this, I'm hoping to have some time left over at the end of my journey to try and apply the skills I have learned through completing these projects to more biology/bioinformatics based problems.

Highlights of the projects I completed have been uploaded:

[bandname generator](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day1/day1_bandname.py)

[tip calculator](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day1/day1_tipcalc.py)

[bmi checker](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day1/day1_bmichecker.py)

[pizza order](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day1/day1_pizza.py)

[treasure island game](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day1/day1_game.py)


### Thoughts

While I did enjoy these little coding tasks, I didn't find them very challenging as I am very comfortable with for loops etc, however this was fun and I'm excited for tomorrow's little coding projects.

## Day 2: 2nd March 2021

### Today's progress:

Continued the udemy projects, got through days 4 and 5 of this course today. The topics mainly covered were loops (which I am very comfortable using anyway) and random number generation (which I am less familiar with). These tasks were definitely a small step up from yesterday, but still not overly challenging. I'm excited to continue this journey, hopefully in a couple of days I will find the tasks a bit more challenging.

Highlights of the projects I completed have been uploaded:

[coin toss](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day2/day2_cointoss.py)

[rock paper scissors](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day2/day2_rockpaper.py)

[basic password generator](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day2/day2_password.py)

### Thoughts

Pretty much the same as yesterday, I was quite tired today so maybe it was for the best! Excited for tomorrow :)

## Day 3: 3rd March 2021

I realise I wanted to keep this seperate from work but I used my 1 hour of #100daysofcode time to debug some code and create some interactive figures for my thesis using the plotly module in python. I really enjoyed this as I'm used to plotting figures using ggplot in R, or if I do use python I use matplotlib or seaborn. This was a nice change!

Haven't made code public as it's currently in a privite thesis repository - will make it public once I submit!

## Day 4: 4th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Elaborated on yesterdays work to create a more complex password generator where the letters/symbols/numbers are shuffled. Also completed Hurdle challenges 1-4 and the maze in [Reeborgs world](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html)

Password generator can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day4/day4_password_difficult.py)

### Thoughts

I really enjoyed the Reeborgs world challenges, it was good to have the visualisation of where things were going wrong which allowed me to debug and fix my code. Excited for tomorrow!
