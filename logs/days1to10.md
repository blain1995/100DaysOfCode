# Log of days 1 to 10

## Day 1: 1st March 2021

### Today's progress:

Aware that I have learnt python in a very "on the job" approach, I'm used to using python for data wrangling/visualisation but may have some knowledge gaps.
Because of this I've decided to attempt to keep these projects seperate from the data science projects I am used to working on, and push myself to expand my python knowledge and skillset.

Decided to go back to basics and follow a udemy course which has tonnes of projects. I got through 3 days worth of projects on a udemy course I am following, as this was fairly easy for me. The quiz they have suggested I could skip ahead, but I think I am going to power through the basics over the next few days so I can experience all the projects. Because of this, I'm hoping to have some time left over at the end of my journey to try and apply the skills I have learned through completing these projects to more biology/bioinformatics based problems.

Highlights of the projects I completed have been uploaded:

[bandname generator](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day1/day1_bandname.py)

[tip calculator](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day1/day1_tipcalc.py)

[bmi checker](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day1/day1_bmichecker.py)

[pizza order](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day1/day1_pizza.py)

[treasure island game](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day1/day1_game.py)


### Thoughts

While I did enjoy these little coding tasks, I didn't find them very challenging as I am very comfortable with for loops etc, however this was fun and I'm excited for tomorrow's little coding projects.

## Day 2: 2nd March 2021

### Today's progress:

Continued the udemy projects, got through days 4 and 5 of this course today. The topics mainly covered were loops (which I am very comfortable using anyway) and random number generation (which I am less familiar with). These tasks were definitely a small step up from yesterday, but still not overly challenging. I'm excited to continue this journey, hopefully in a couple of days I will find the tasks a bit more challenging.

Highlights of the projects I completed have been uploaded:

[coin toss](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day2/day2_cointoss.py)

[rock paper scissors](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day2/day2_rockpaper.py)

[basic password generator](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day2/day2_password.py)

### Thoughts

Pretty much the same as yesterday, I was quite tired today so maybe it was for the best! Excited for tomorrow :)

## Day 3: 3rd March 2021

I realise I wanted to keep this seperate from work but I used my 1 hour of #100daysofcode time to debug some code and create some interactive figures for my thesis using the plotly module in python. I really enjoyed this as I'm used to plotting figures using ggplot in R, or if I do use python I use matplotlib or seaborn. This was a nice change!

Haven't made code public as it's currently in a privite thesis repository - will make it public once I submit!

## Day 4: 4th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Elaborated on yesterdays work to create a more complex password generator where the letters/symbols/numbers are shuffled. Also completed Hurdle challenges 1-4 and the maze in [Reeborgs world](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html)

Password generator can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day4/day4_password_difficult.py)

### Thoughts

I really enjoyed the Reeborgs world challenges, it was good to have the visualisation of where things were going wrong which allowed me to debug and fix my code. Excited for tomorrow!

## Day 5: 5th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I have built my own hangman game which has three levels of difficulty. A random word is generated using the random_words module and then difficulty determines the max length of the word picked at random.

The word has to be a dictionary defined word. The game also prints out the stage based on number of incorrect guesses, each time the user starts with 6 lives. The game ends when either lives == 0 or all the letters have been guessed.

The hangman script can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day5/day5_hangman.py)

### Thoughts:

If I'm honest, I really like this project - I think it's my favourite project I've worked on so far! I'm happy I managed to completed it with little googling.

Bit sad but I'm actually really proud of this! 

## Day 6: 6th March 2021

### Today's progress:

I realised I had a small bug in yesterdays hangman script for the easy mode, so today I rectified this. I then also created a [number checker](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day6/day6_primecheck.py) to determine if a number is a prime number or not.

Finally, I spent the rest of my hour coding making a [cipher script](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day6/day6_decoder.py) which can encode and decode messages by shifting alphabetical characters along by a predetermined number. This loads an alphabet and a logo from a seperate [script](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day6/day6_decodeart.py)

### Thoughts:

I found these challenges enjoyable, I'm getting better at debugging and fixing small errors.

## Day 7: 7th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a [silent auction program](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day7/day7_silentauction.py)  which uses a dictionary to store bids and once all bids have been entered, loops through the keys to identify the highest bid and winner.

I also learned how to clear the console within the script. This won't work if using an IDE like PyCharm but will work when script is ran using terminal.

This script also imports a logo from a seperate [art script](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day7/day7_art.py)

### Thoughts:

Definitely a bit more comfortable with dictionaries now. In the past I've learnt about dictionaries using DataCamp etc but haven't really had much need for them in my everyday work. This project has definitely helped me feel more confident using them.

## Day 8: 8th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a program to make a [leap year calculator](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day8/day8_leapyear.py) and also a normal [calculator](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day8/day8_calculator.py) which uses a logo imported from an [art script](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day8/day8_art.py)

### Thoughts:

Not my favourite projects if I'm honest!

## Day 9: 9th March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a [blackjack game!](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day9/day9_blackjack.py) using art from a seperate [script](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/day9/day9_art.py)

### Thoughts:

I really enjoyed this, although it did take me a little over an hour to write and debug - there is still a small bug where occasionally the program claims the cards add up to 95.. when there are three cards!

I'm going to try and fix this bug over the weekend but for now I am way too tired! Also I want to incorporate a dictionary so I can use the king/queen/jack/ace instead of just using values of 2 - 11.

Lots of functions and while loops again but excited to move onto bigger things.
