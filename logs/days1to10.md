# Log of days 1 to 10

## Day 1: 1st March 2021

### Today's progress:

Aware that I have learnt python in a very "on the job" approach, I'm used to using python for data wrangling/visualisation but may have some knowledge gaps.
Because of this I've decided to attempt to keep these projects seperate from the data science projects I am used to working on, and push myself to expand my python knowledge and skillset.

Decided to go back to basics and follow a udemy course which has tonnes of projects. I got through 3 days worth of projects on a udemy course I am following, as this was fairly easy for me. The quiz they have suggested I could skip ahead, but I think I am going to power through the basics over the next few days so I can experience all the projects. Because of this, I'm hoping to have some time left over at the end of my journey to try and apply the skills I have learned through completing these projects to more biology/bioinformatics based problems.

Highlights of the projects I completed have been uploaded:

### Thoughts

While I did enjoy these little coding tasks, I didn't find them very challenging as I am very comfortable with for loops etc, however this was fun and I'm excited for tomorrow's little coding projects.
