# Log of days 81 to 90

## Day 81: 24th June 2021

### Today's progress:

Played around with more pandas and matplotlib - getting a bit more used to making figures in python! Raw data and code can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days81to90/day81)

### Thoughts:

Happy to be back in the swing of 100 days of code!

## Day 82: 26th June 2021

### Today's progress:

Looked more into matplotlib and started playing around with different aesthetics for some different datasets. I compared the number of google searches for tesla and bitcoin against stock prices and then also unemployment rate vs unemployment google searches.

Raw data and code can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days81to90/day82)

### Thoughts:

A bit fiddly but fun!

## Day 83: 27th Jun 2021

Used today's coding time to complete some of the Rosalind bioinformatics problems with python. This has been uploaded to my ROSALIND_solutions repo.

### Thoughts:

Really enjoyed this!
