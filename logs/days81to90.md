# Log of days 81 to 90

## Day 81: 24th June 2021

### Today's progress:

Played around with more pandas and matplotlib - getting a bit more used to making figures in python! Raw data and code can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days81to90/day81)

### Thoughts:

Happy to be back in the swing of 100 days of code!
