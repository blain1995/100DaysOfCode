# Log of days 61 to 70

## Day 71: 13th May 2021

### Today's progress:

Used Selenium to scrape data from pubmed and web of science as a fun little literature search exercise

### Thoughts:

Had a busy day so found this project to be weirdly relaxing! 

## Day 72: 15th May 2021

### Today's progress:

Learned how to use basic SQL to create a [library project](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days71to80/day72) where you can add books and rate them, edit the rating of existing books in the database and then delete books too.

### Thoughts:

I enjoyed this, think SQL will take a little while to get used to but hopefully this will be useful in the future :)

## Day 73: 16th May 2021

### Today's progress:

Started a capstone project which is an improvement on a previous movie rating website that I started a while ago. This updated project uses Flask, Jinja, WTForms, SQL and API keys to display my top 10 films, with the ability to update ratings, add and delete films. Project is not quite finished yet - will finish and upload tomorrow.

### Thoughts:

Finding this challenging, but this is good because it's forcing me to revisit APIs and a few other python methods that I haven't used in a while.

## Day 74: 18th May 2021

### Today's progress:

Got the API to work so that you can now add a new film to the ranked list by querying the API and it displays all the options with a matching title. Tomorrow's job is to get it working so that you can select the film specifically and send the information to the add.html page

### Thoughts: 

I am exhausted this week as I have organised a virtual science festival for the public - definitely trying to do too much at once. Excited to finish this project tomorrow.

## Day 75: 26th May 2021

### Today's progress:

Finally finished my top movies project. All the files are [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days71to80/day73)

### Thoughts:

Took a few days off as juggling pint of science and PhD and an hour of code each day proved to be a bit overwhelming - but feeling energised and ready for the final 25 days.
