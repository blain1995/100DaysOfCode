# Log of days 61 to 70

## Day 71: 13th May 2021

### Today's progress:

Used Selenium to scrape data from pubmed and web of science as a fun little literature search exercise

### Thoughts:

Had a busy day so found this project to be weirdly relaxing! 

## Day 72: 15th May 2021

### Today's progress:

Learned how to use basic SQL to create a [library project](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days71to80/day72) where you can add books and rate them, edit the rating of existing books in the database and then delete books too.

### Thoughts:

I enjoyed this, think SQL will take a little while to get used to but hopefully this will be useful in the future :)
