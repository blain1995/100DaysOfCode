# Log of days 31 to 40

## Day 31: 31st March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a habit tracker which uses the API [Pixela](https://pixe.la/) to create a habit graph, similar to the ones you see on github to record peoples daily number of commits.

You can find my habit tracker script [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days31to40/day31/day31_main.py) I used cycling as an example (even though I can't remember the last time I cycled! But I may actually use this to keep track of my daily number of pages read and maybe also thesis writing... we will see

### Thoughts:

LOVED today's project and actually think the end product looks really cute
