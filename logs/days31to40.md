# Log of days 31 to 40

## Day 31: 31st March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a habit tracker which uses the API [Pixela](https://pixe.la/) to create a habit graph, similar to the ones you see on github to record peoples daily number of commits.

You can find my habit tracker script [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days31to40/day31/day31_main.py) I used cycling as an example (even though I can't remember the last time I cycled! But I may actually use this to keep track of my daily number of pages read and maybe also thesis writing... we will see

### Thoughts:

LOVED today's project and actually think the end product looks really cute

## Day 32: 1st April 2021

### Today's progress:

I made a [script](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days31to40/day32/day32_main.py) to automatically update a google spreadsheet of exercise completed per day.

### Thoughts:

again really enjoyed this project, will maybe use this in future!

## Day 32: 2nd April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I started a flight price tracker! Admittedly it's not fully debugged yet... still having quite a lot of issues.

I have high hopes for this but will have to finish this tomorrow - so unfortunately no code upload today :(

### Thoughts:

Interesting but difficult!
