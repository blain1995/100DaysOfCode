# Log of days 31 to 40

## Day 31: 31st March 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I made a habit tracker which uses the API [Pixela](https://pixe.la/) to create a habit graph, similar to the ones you see on github to record peoples daily number of commits.

You can find my habit tracker script [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days31to40/day31/day31_main.py) I used cycling as an example (even though I can't remember the last time I cycled! But I may actually use this to keep track of my daily number of pages read and maybe also thesis writing... we will see

### Thoughts:

LOVED today's project and actually think the end product looks really cute

## Day 32: 1st April 2021

### Today's progress:

I made a [script](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days31to40/day32/day32_main.py) to automatically update a google spreadsheet of exercise completed per day.

### Thoughts:

again really enjoyed this project, will maybe use this in future!

## Day 33: 2nd April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I started a flight price tracker! Admittedly it's not fully debugged yet... still having quite a lot of issues.

I have high hopes for this but will have to finish this tomorrow - so unfortunately no code upload today :(

### Thoughts:

Interesting but difficult!

## Day 34: 3rd April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I finished the flight price tracker! All the scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days31to40/day33) finally got rid of all the issues. The program inspects a google doc with information of cities I would like to visit, within this spreadsheet there is a column with the maximum price per city that I would be willing to spend. 

Then the flight information for the next 6 months is inspected for each city using the tequila flight API, the cheapest flight is selected and if the price is below the max I'm willing to pay, I recieve a text message with the flight info. 

### Thoughts:

Difficult but I think this was a good refresh of some skills I have learnt over the past few weeks. Tomorrow I am going to attempt add a GUI to this.

## Day 35: 4th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Changed the flight price tracker scripts so that users can sign up to be added to the google doc and then once cheap flights are found all users in the spreadsheet are emailed. The updated scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days31to40/day35)

### Thoughts:

Today wasn't too bad, yesterdays coding was definitely a bit trickier, but excited to move onto something else to be honest!

## Day 36: 5th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I started to learn basic html, I would like to eventually build my own website so I can have a place for all the links to various projects/science communication talks I have been apart of. The html files I have created can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days31to40/day36)

### Thoughts:

I don't know why I always assumed html was difficult and super confusing, maybe because blocks of html can be a bit intimidating to look at if you have no clue what is going on. I enjoyed today, going to learn a bit more about html and css over the next few days so I can start doing more website focused projects

## Day 37: 6th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Today I learnt about tables and forms in html, the updated files can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days31to40/day37)

### Thoughts:

Found today's exercise fairly simple, definitely more equipped to start thinking about designing my own webiste now but am going to learn some CSS so it doesn't look like a potato :)

## Day 38: 7th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Started learning some very basic CSS today and updated my little practice website to use external CSS. The updated files can be found [here](https://github.com/blain1995/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/scripts/days31to40/day38)

### Thoughts:

I did enjoy today although I think it'll take a little while to get used to. I did intend to do more but I am absoloutely exhausted so going to have an early night and try again tomorrow :)

## Day 39: 8th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Continued with some more advanced CSS, however have just been playing around with different parameters so don't have any code of value to upload today! Will aim to have something to upload tomorrow :)

### Thoughts:

Learning HTML and CSS with the intention of being able to design my own website containing links to all my public talks/publications/social media. Hopefully things will get a bit easier as time goes on and my skills develop!

## Day 40: 9th April 2021

### Today's progress:

Learnt about relative and absoloute positioning in CSS and played around with some website formatting.

### Thoughts:

Not the biggest fan of CSS if I'm honest but maybe that will change...
