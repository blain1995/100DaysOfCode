# 100DaysOfCode

## Introduction
Decided to commit to completing 100 days of code.

This is a challenge started by Alexander Kallaway, you can read more about it [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com)

I am going to begin my journey on the 1st March 2021, which will give me an end date of 9th June 2021.

My main focus during this project is going to be to improve my python skills, but I may from time to time use R.

## Rules
The two main rules are:

1. You must code for 1 hour every day
2. this does not include following tutorials.

You are also encouraged to tweet along using #100DaysOfCode
